This project consists of building an application, which will be able to calculate the average waiting time of a person when they are queuing in a single-file system. With this information it will be possible to suggest when it is necessary to open a new box so that customers do not wait too long and thus generate a better experience.

To make this application is using technologies such as computer vision and artificial neural networks, which with this combination can be obtained the detection of objects, which in this case will be people. 

\vspace{5mm}
In the case of the neural network, it was decided to use YOLO (You Only Look Once), which according to several reports is one of the best when talking about object detection in real time, to be able to detect people first had to train this neural network through a large number of images where people appear.

\vspace{5mm}
This work can be used in any store that uses a single-row system, since it was designed to solve a problem that arises, which is how many boxes have to be open in different periods of time in the attention.
